# SAVE-PASSWORD-VUEJS-PWAPP
This application is used to save your passwords. So, first of all, I need to comment that it is a PWA (progressive web app), this means that it can be installed on mobile phones.

The project is developed in vue, using vuex, to keep and save the data, and onsen.ui as a compoent library.
